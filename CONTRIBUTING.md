# How to Contribute

Ruby Bench is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in.

* Fork the repository.
* Create a topic branch for your feature.
* Make commits of logical units.
  * Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --chek` before committing.
  * Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
  * Run all the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.
* Push your commits and open a Pull Request linking to your branch.

If you have push access to the repository, you should never push directly to master.  
Please apply the same rules to yourself and wait for a :+1: to merge the PR.

## Making documentation changes

If you're improving the documentation and does not in any way changes the code,
you don't need to run the tests.

Please also add `[ci skip]` to your commit message.
